# Africa Trade and Energy Indicators Database

## Description

This repository houses code used to create a database of energy infrastructure statistics, energy cost projections, and human development indicators for Africa derived three different from World Bank and Energy Institute datasets.

Additionally, it contains files for querying and visualizations derived from these queries that answer the question of how different trade scenarios impact electricity cost and access across different countries in Africa.

## Data Visualizations

Please see `data_visualization.ipynb` for the code used to create these visualizations.

These packages are required for data cleaning: `os`, `numpy`, `pandas` and data visualization: `duckdb`, `geopandas` `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `pandas`, `seaborn`.

## Database Schema

The below diagram, created using [dbdiagram.io](https://dbdiagram.io/home) outlines the structure and organization of the database. It contains four tables: `countries`, `ida_indicators`, `africa_electricity`, and `energy_institute`.
